                <p>Penguins are fascinating birds that are well-adapted to life in the water. They are excellent swimmers and have a streamlined body for efficient underwater movement. Unlike many other birds, penguins are not capable of flight, but their wings have evolved into flippers that help them navigate through the ocean with incredible agility.</p>
